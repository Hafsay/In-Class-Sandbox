# In-Class-Sandbox

Here, I am learning about using my github version control system.

the 'README.md' file is a markdown file where I can share important notes about my code repository.

I can create **bold** text (wrapped by two asterisks) or *italics* text (wrapped by one asterisk).

I can create fenced code blocks using back-ticks, like this:

```csharp 
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
Console.Writeline("Hello World");
}
```

I am learning about

- Creating  a git repository (online, and on my computer)
-synchronizing my git repository on [GitHub] https://github.com
